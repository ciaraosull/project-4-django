# **Code Connects**

## Overview

Code Connects is a website that aims to create an online peer code review community.  This site allows people to share their personal or educational software development projects they are working on with others in the hope of having fresh eyes on their code and having a user base to test their deployed projects on others.

Users can login, post their project description, source code and deployed sites so that others can view, comment and make suggestions.  This site also aims to help people learn from each other’s ideas, suggestions and mistakes in a supportive online community.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

As a user I want to:

*	Easily understand the main purpose of the site, so that I can learn more about how to use the site.
*	Easily navigate around the site, so that I can find content and understand where I am on the site.
*	Be provided with a summary of all posts by most recent first so that I can glance through quickly to decide which post to read in full.
*	Read other users’ posts in full detail and comments related to those posts so that I can decide to review and offer feedback to that user and not repeat other suggestions from comments by other users.
*	Register my account, so that I can post my projects, update and delete them if I wish.
*	Register my account, so that I can comment on other’s posts, update and delete my comments if I wish.
*	Easily log in and log out of my account, so that I can access my personal information.
*	View my profile so that I can update my information such as username, email and profile image.
*	Find links easily so that I can contact the site owner if needed.
*	 Clearly see what user posted which projects and comments so that I can make a connection.
*	See clearly what date a post or comment was created so that I can clearly see how relevant and up to date the information is.
*	 Clearly see how many comments are attached to a post before clicking in to read it fully so that I can decide to read and also comment depending on whether others have commented already.
*	Post my projects to the site so that I can connect with others and receive feedback on my project.
*	Update and delete my own project posts so that I can keep the information up to date or fix any mistakes I notice.
*	Comment on my own project posts so that I can reply to other users’ comments
*	Comment on other user’s projects so that I can connect with others by giving feedback
*	Update or delete my comments so that I can keep the information up to date and relevant or fix any mistakes I notice.
*	Access the site on various devices such as desktop, tablet or mobile to that I can use the site no matter what device I have to hand.
*	Understand when an error occurs so that I am given clear feedback on what I should do.
*	Be aware when my actions have had a successful outcome so that I know when I have updated or deleted a post or comments or if I am logged in or out successfully.


### Agile Approach in this Project

An Agile Approach was used to develop this site.  According to a report from the Standish Group (2018), Agile projects are statistically twice more likely to succeed, and a third less likely to fail than waterfall projects.  
Each activity was broken down into small bite-sized portions and performed iteratively, so that as it was repeated, it was tweaked and improved on with each cycle.

The User Stories were created, and these are small, self-contained units of development work designed to accomplish a specific goal.  These user stories then had acceptance criteria attached for each so that it was clear when the user stories were achieved as each of these conditions were met.  The acceptance criteria where then further broken down into tasks.  These tasks were the list of actions required to implement the user story. They described the technical work details and activities to be performed to complete each user story properly.

**Example:**

    **User Story Profile Page:**

    As a User, I would like to be able to easily view my profile page so that I can update my account from there and display the information I would like others to see

    Acceptance Criteria 1
    Given that I am a registered user who is logged in
    When I click the Profile link in the navigate bar
    Then I am taken to my profile page and can see my details displayed

    Acceptance Criteria 2
    Given that I am a registered user who is logged in
    When I navigate to my profile page and edit my details
    Then I can click an update button and be alerted that my information was updated successfully.

    Tasks:
    *	create a profile app for users’ functionality
    *	create signal to create a user profile when a new user signs up
    *	link up views & templates & URLs and display link to profile page in nav after user is logged in
    *	display logged in users name on the profile page
    *	create a profile model to add profile picture, contact details such as email
    *	create form to allow users to be able to edit the information displayed on their profile page
    *	add update button for users to click to submit their changes
    *	show success message when user profile update
    *   manually test this works


Story points estimated the effort required to complete a particular User Story in one iteration.  To create a Product Backlog GitHub Milestones was used to track progress on groups of issues relating to the user stories.

Timeboxing defined the iteration where the User Stories were developed based on the assigned priority.  The MoSCoW Prioritization technique was used to assign priorities for Product Backlog Items to be completed in a particular time box.  GitHub Labels was used to categories the User Stories into Must Have, Should Have and Could Have. This clearly showed which User Stories were more important to implement first and in what order.  This kept the scope of the project in focus at all times and only implemented what was essential to the user first.

Information radiators in Agile show real-time, informative and straightforward work status.  This project used a Kaban board, which was set up in GitHub Projects to help keep track of work to do, in progress and completed.

Within the timeframe work stopped with over 73% of the timebox user story points total of all Must Have and some Should Have prioritised user stories.  Only 1 Should Have and 3 Could Have were left uncompleted and are documented in the future features section below.
